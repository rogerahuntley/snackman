# snackman
open-source pacman / snake clone in c++

I was working on this game to help me learn c++. It helped me develop [ecpps](https://github.com/rogerthat52/ecpps). The game isn't fully working yet, it draws a map to the screen but the collision code never got finished so the game doesn't really work yet. I'm hoping to come back to it later, possibly as a school project.
